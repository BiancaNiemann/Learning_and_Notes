# Ingest Data in Databricks
## Data Ingestion
- Getting the data into databricks
- Usually data engineer or data warehouse managers job

---
## Delta Lakes
- goal of data ingestion is to bring files from external sources like the cloud into Delta lake as delta tables
- Delta tables offer and open table format that supports Lakehouse architecture
- Supports full SQl as well as Python and Scala

---
## Delta Tables
- Delta tables store data within a folder directory (as parquet files)
- Delta adds delta logs as JSON files alongside these files
- Delta logs keep track of all transactions on the parquet files and table versions

---
## Delta Lake Summary
- ACID transaction support, DML support and ability to time travel
- ACID - atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) - allow multi users to read and write concurrently without conflicts
- Supports DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations like - INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and MERGE
- Time travel allows users to query and revert to previous versions of data
- Also open source

## Data Transformation
- Data bricks recommends Medallion Architecture
- Goal is to incrementally and progresively improve the structore and quality of the data
- BRONZE LAYER
  - Raw ingestion layer, ingests unprocessed data from various sources
- SILVER LAYER
  - Data is cleaned, transformed and enriched
  - Providing more refined dataset suitable for analysis
- GOLD LAYER
  - contains curated, aggregated and high quality data
  - Optimised for reporting and advanced analytics
  - often used in BI applications

---
## Data Transformation Reality
- Not just a traight line, more complex
- May ingest into multiple bronze tables
- Combine and clean data into multiple silver tables and combine those into more silver tables
- And further divide and combine data downstream into gold tables
- With Unity catelog can track linage of data as it travels through these various stages and states to check compliance and understand data at granular level

---
## Data Ingestion Pipelines
- Using the UI
- using the read_files function
- using COPY INTO
